Id based data comparision with custom columns

db1 is a source and db2 is destination database


Input:
    - db1.events has 2 records
    - db2.events has 2 records with discrepant quantity and event type is swapped
            thus SUM and COUNT do not detect discrepancy

    - sync request with
        - id based synchronization
        - job id: $index
        - diff.columns: SUM(event_type), COUNT(DISTINCT event_type)


Output:
   -  db2.events are not synchronized since no changed data has been identified
   -  job status: http://localhost:8081/v1/api/job/$index
      - source count: 0
      - dest count: 0
      - transferred: 0
