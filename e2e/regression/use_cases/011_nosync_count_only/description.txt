Id based data comparision with countOnly

db1 is a source and db2 is destination database


Input:
    - db1.events has 2 records
    - db2.events has 2 records with discrepant quantity and event type
    - sync request with
        - id based synchronization
        - job id: $index
        - diff.countOnly: true

Output:
   -  db2.events are not synchronized since no changed data has been identified
   -  job status: http://localhost:8081/v1/api/job/$index
      - source count: 0
      - dest count: 0
      - transferred: 0

Comments:
    Since countOnly data comparision check rows count and MAX(ID), MIN(ID), no change has been detected in this scenario,
    make sure to use countOnly when source data ingestion type is only append.
