Id and partition based synchronization with insert strategy test,
db1 is a source and db2 is destination database

Input:
    - db1.events partition (event_type=3): 5 records, partition 2: 5 records
    - db2.events partition (event_type=3): 5 records, partition 2: only first 2 records
    - sync request with
        - id based synchronization
        - partition on event_type column, 2 partition threads, job id: $index
          and sqlProvider defined as: SELECT event_type FROM db1.events GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1

Output:
   -  db2.events has all data synchronized from db1.events
   -  job status: http://localhost:8081/v1/api/job/$index
      - source count: 5
      - dest count: 2
      - transferred: 3
