Chunk criteria synchronizes source with destination with criteria: event_type <= 8, and chunk size 10.

    - data between db1 and db2 is in sync upto ID 4, thus only 3 chunks are used.
    - each chunk uses insert method to transfer data to transient 'chunk table'.
    - after combining all chunks table to temp transient table,  INSERT is used to append data to target db2.event table.
    - sync request with
         - non-id based synchronization
         - job id: $index
         - criteria: "event_type": " <= 8 "
         - chunk.size: 5
         - diff.countOnly: true

Input:
    db1.events - 21 records from ID 1 to 21
    db2.events - data in sync from ID 1 to 4

Output:
    db2.events
