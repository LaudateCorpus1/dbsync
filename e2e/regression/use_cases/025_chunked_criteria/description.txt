Chunk criteria synchronizes source with destination with criteria: event_type <= 8, and chunk size 10.

- Data between db1 and db2 is in sync upto ID 4, thus only 3 chunks are used.
- Each chunk uses insert method to transfer data to transient 'chunk table'.
- After combining all chunks table to temp transient table,  INSERT is used to append data to target db2.event table.

Input:
    db1.events - 21 records from ID 1 to 21
    db2.events - data in sync from ID 1 to 4

Output:
    db2.events
