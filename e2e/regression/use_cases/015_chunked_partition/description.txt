db1 is a source and db2 is destination database

Input:
    - db1.events 9999 records
    - db2.events has 7 record, where last record in event_type=10 partition has the highest value
    - sync request with
        - id based synchronization
        - job id: $index
        - chunk.size: 4096
        - partition on event_type column, 1 partition threads
          and sqlProvider defined as: SELECT event_type FROM db1.events GROUP BY 1 ORDER BY 1

Output:
   -  db2.events has all records synchronized from db1.events
   -  job status: http://localhost:8081/v1/api/job/$index
      - source count: 9999
      - dest count: 7
      - transferred: 9999
